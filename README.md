# Flex OverFlow

The Flex Overflow team is comprised of four Full Stack Engineers collaborating on one specific idea, Preparation

## User Story
As a coding student I want to be able to post questions or answer questions of my fellow students. I also want to be able to quiz myself on possible interview questions. So that I can be prepared for any new challenges. 
We at Flex Overflow understand that you can never be over prepared when it comes to job and skill knowledge. 
We wanted to help create an app that will not only help you prepare for your next big interview but connect with those peers on some of the more in depth questions that will come up during the length of a Full Stack Course. 
Our mission is to help coders collectively prepare for the road ahead and create a platform that will connect users worldwide.

## Acceptance Criteria 

1. Given that, I go to the page in the browser, a launch page is open to initiate a log in with a "Get Started" button.
2. Given that, I am taken to a log in page in which I log in for the first time, I am taken to a sign up page.
3. Given that, the home page is a question posting page with a form box to input a question or answer other users' questions, with my profile panel on the side.
4. Given that, I go to the randomize page, a new question is shown. When the "show answer" button is clicked, the corresponding answer is displayed. When the "new random question" button is clicked, a new question is displayed.
